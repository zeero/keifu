keifu (系譜, /keːɸɯ/) is a terminal UI tool that visualizes Git commit graphs. It shows a colored commit graph, commit details, and a summary of changed files, and lets you perform basic branch operations.

![Screenshot](docs/win_terminal.png)

## Motivation

- **Readable commit graph** — `git log --graph` is hard to read; keifu renders a cleaner, color-coded graph
- **Fast branch switching** — With AI-assisted coding, working on multiple branches in parallel has become common. keifu makes branch switching quick and visual
- **Keep it simple** — Only basic Git operations are supported; this is not a full-featured Git client
- **Narrow terminal friendly** — Works well in split panes and small windows
- **Sixel support** — Compatible with Windows Terminal and other Sixel-capable terminals

## Features

- Unicode commit graph with per-branch colors
- Commit list with branch labels, date, author, short hash, and message (some fields may be hidden on narrow terminals)
- Commit detail panel with full message and changed file stats (+/-)
- Git operations: checkout, create/delete branch, fetch
- Branch search with dropdown UI

## Requirements

- Run inside a Git repository (auto-discovery from current directory)
- A terminal with Unicode line drawing support and color
- `git` command in PATH (required for fetch)
- Rust toolchain (for building from source)

## Installation

```bash
cargo install keifu
```

| `]` / `Tab` | Jump to next commit that has branch labels |
| `[` / `Shift+Tab` | Jump to previous commit that has branch labels |
| `h` / `←` | Select left branch (same commit) |
| `l` / `→` | Select right branch (same commit) |
| `Ctrl+d` | Page down |
| `Ctrl+u` | Page up |
| `g` / `Home` | Go to top |

| `d` | Delete branch (local, non-HEAD) |
| `f` | Fetch from origin |

### Search

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Search branches (incremental fuzzy search) |

| `↓` / `Ctrl+j` | Select next result |
| `Enter` | Jump to selected branch |
| `Esc` / `Backspace` on empty | Cancel search |

### Other

| `R` | Refresh repository data |
| `?` | Toggle help |
| `q` / `Esc` | Quit |

## Notes and limitations

- The TUI loads up to 500 commits across all branches.
- Merge commits are diffed against the first parent; the initial commit is diffed against an empty tree.
- Changed files are capped at 50 and binary files are skipped.
- If there are staged or unstaged changes (excluding untracked files), an "uncommitted changes" row appears at the top.
- When multiple branches point to the same commit, the label is collapsed to a single name with a `+N` suffix (e.g., `main +2`). Use `h`/`l` or `←`/`→` to switch between them.
- Checking out `origin/xxx` creates or updates a local branch. Upstream is set only when creating a new branch. If the local branch exists but points to a different commit, it is force-updated to match the remote.
- Remote branches are displayed, but delete operations only work with local branches.
- Fetch requires the `origin` remote to be configured.
